# Here i Create a Robo Search app Using React
```
Here Is The Simple Explainations of This Code For New One !
```
This code is a React application that displays a list of robots and provides a search functionality to filter the robots based on user input. Here's a breakdown of the code:

The code imports the necessary components from other files, such as Cardlist, Searchbox, React, and Spinner.

The App component is defined as a class that extends the Component class from React. It sets the initial state with an empty array for robots, an empty string for the searchfield, and a loading flag set to false.

The componentDidMount lifecycle method is used to fetch data from a remote API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) when the component is mounted. It uses the fetch function to make a request and updates the state with the received data. It also sets the loading flag to true before the fetch request and false after receiving the data.

The onSearchChange method is triggered when the user types in the search input field. It updates the state's searchfield with the current value of the input field.

The render method is responsible for rendering the UI of the component. It filters the robots array based on the current value of the searchfield using the filter method. It also conditionally renders a loading spinner component (Spinner) based on the loading flag.

The Scroll component is a custom component that wraps the Cardlist component. It provides a scrolling effect for the robot cards.

The rendered UI consists of a heading, a search input field (Searchbox), the loading spinner (if loading is true), and the list of robot cards (Cardlist) based on the filtered robots.

The App component is exported as the default export, which means it can be imported and used in other files.

In summary, this code demonstrates the following concepts:

1) Component-based architecture with React.
2) Fetching data from a remote API using fetch.
3) Managing component state using setState.
4) Filtering an array based on user input.
5) Conditionally rendering components.
6) Using lifecycle methods like componentDidMount.
7) Separating code into reusable components.
8) Importing and using external modules and components.
9) Adding scrolling effects with a custom component.
10) Using a loading spinner component to indicate data loading.
Overall, this code provides a basic example of a React application that fetches and displays data while allowing users to search and filter the displayed content.
